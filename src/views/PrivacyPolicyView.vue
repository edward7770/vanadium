                  YUNS Funds Management Pty Ltd trading as Vanadium Fund Management (ABN 80 660 202 700, AFSL 543698) and
                  its associated entities (“Vanadium”, “we”) recognises the importance of privacy protection in ensuring
                  that our clients and other business associates have confidence in the way Vanadium handles the personal
                  information they may provide to us.
                  <br /><br />
                  Vanadium only collects personal information that is necessary for one or more of its functions or
                  activities. This document sets out Vanadium’s policy for handling personal information in accordance
                  with
                  relevant laws. Vanadium is bound by, and committed to, the terms of the Australian Privacy Act 1988
                  (Cth),
                  including the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) forming part of that Act.

                <h5> Personal information </h5>
                <p class="pb-3">
                  Personal information is any information or an opinion about an individual that identifies the
                  individual,
                  or by which their identity can reasonably be ascertained.<br /><br />
                  The personal information Vanadium may collect includes but is not limited to individuals’ names,
                  signatures, date of birth, telephone numbers, email address, residential address, nationality, country
                  of
                  residence for tax purposes, banking details and tax file number or exemption details.<br /><br />
                  Sensitive information is personal information relating to racial or ethnic origin, political persuasion,
                  religious or philosophical beliefs and other specified categories. Vanadium will only collect sensitive
                  information if you consent and the collection is reasonably necessary for Vanadium’s functions or
                  activities (for example, to identify applicants who may be ‘Politically Exposed Persons’); or if
                  required
                  or authorised by or under an Australian law or court/tribunal order.
                </p>
                <p> In addition to the Privacy Act 1988, laws that govern Vanadium’s handling of your personal information
                  may relevantly include: </p>
                <ul class="pb-5">
                  <li> The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (C’th) </li>
                  <li> The Corporations Act 2001 (C’th) </li>
                  <li> The FATCA intergovernmental Agreement in respect of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, which
                    is
                    United States legislation designed to improve compliance with US tax laws</li>
                  <li> The Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the Common Reporting Standard) Act 2016 (C’th), which is
                    designed to implement in Australia the OECD’s CRS for the automatic exchange of financial account
                    information between the CRS signatory countries. </li>

              </div>
              <div>
                <h2> Why Vanadium collects your personal information </h2>
                <p> Vanadium collects personal information in order to: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Respond to enquiries, including enquiries about its products and services </li>
                  <li> Provide its clients with the services they request </li>
                  <li> Complete business transactions and purchase products and services from its suppliers </li>
                  <li> Undertake marketing to clients and gather data that, when aggregated, can be used to improve
                    website
                    functionality and inform marketing strategy </li>
                  <li> Comply with relevant laws, regulations and court orders. </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="pb-5"> If the personal information Vanadium has requested is not provided, Vanadium may not be
                  able to do business with the relevant individual or the organisation with which the individual is
                  connected. If an individual’s tax file number is not provided, deductions from distributions may be
                  required. Vanadium generally cannot deal with individuals who opt not to identify themselves but will
                  consider whether anonymity is possible in certain circumstances on request. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h2> How Vanadium collects your personal information </h2>
                <p class="pb-5">
                  Most personal information Vanadium holds is collected from investors’ application forms or provided
                  directly by its clients or their employees or suppliers. This collection may occur over the phone or by
                  mail or email during the course of the client’s relationship with Vanadium. <br /><br />
                  Vanadium also collects personal information via its website, where individuals can provide contact
                  details
                  so that we can respond. Vanadium’s website also collects usage data such as IP addresses and browser
                  type
                  and version, from which individuals could be identifiable. The website also collects information via
                  cookies and similar tracking technologies that assist users to navigate the website. Vanadium will not
                  try
                  to identify you from this data. Website visitors can choose not to agree to use of cookies, but they
                  will
                  experience sub-optimal performance of the website as a result.<br /><br />
                  Sometimes, Vanadium collects information about an individual from other people or organisations. For
                  example, information about a director of a corporate customer may be obtained from a public record
                  relating to Vanadium’s business. We may also collect information from third parties such as authorised
                  representatives or advisors or referees. Vanadium will tell you if it is seeking personal information
                  about you from third parties unless it is impracticable to do so.<br /><br />
                  Regardless of how it is collected, all personal information is handled by Vanadium in accordance with
                  its
                  obligations under the <i>Privacy Act 1988</i>.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h2> How Vanadium uses personal information </h2>
                <p>
                  Vanadium mainly uses the personal information it collects for its stated purposes of collection:
                  responding to enquiries, providing goods and services to clients, doing business with suppliers and
                  complying with relevant laws, regulations and court orders. Vanadium may also use the personal
                  information
                  it collects for its own internal administrative purposes, including website administration as outlined
                  above. Vanadium does not trade in your personal information.<br /><br />
                  Vanadium may also use the personal information individuals provide about themselves for marketing
                  purposes, to provide information about new products and services or special offers from time to time.
                  Website user data, in aggregated form, assists our website administration and marketing
                  strategy.<br /><br />
                  If you do not wish to receive marketing material from Vanadium, please let us know by sending us a
                  written
                  request via a letter addressed to our office at Suite 804, 97-99 Bathurst Street, Sydney NSW 2000, or an
                  email to <a href="mailto:info@vanadiumfunds.com.au" target="_blank">info@vanadiumfunds.com.au</a>, and
                  we
                  will cease sending it to you.<br /><br />
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h2> Disclosure of personal information </h2>
                <p> Generally Vanadium discloses information relating to an individual only for the purpose for which it
                  was collected or for a related purpose that the individual would reasonably expect. </p>
                <p> Where a customer nominates someone else to act on their behalf, for example, the client’s accountant
                  or financial adviser, Vanadium may provide information to that person. Otherwise your personal
                  information may be disclosed in the following circumstances: </p>
                <ul class="pb-5">
                  <li> External service providers: Vanadium obtains some services from other organisations and where
                    necessary (and where the law permits), personal information will be provided to those organisations.
                    The kinds of services obtained externally include information technology support, financial advice,
                    tax and legal advice. This includes provision of personal information to the fund’s trustee AMAL Asset
                    Management Limited and its contractor for identity verification and other purposes related to
                    anti-money laundering. Vanadium seeks to ensure that all its external service providers understand and
                    comply with the APPs when handling your information. External service providers are only authorised to
                    use personal information for the purpose for which Vanadium supplied it, and not for their own
                    purposes. </li>
                  <li> Overseas recipients: Vanadium endeavours not to send personal information outside Australia.
                    However, should it be necessary to do so, for example when using a cloud storage provider in another
                    jurisdiction, Vanadium will seek to ensure that the personal information it transfers receives privacy
                    protection that is substantially similar to the protection afforded in Australia. Vanadium’s servers
                    are located in Singapore. </li>
                  <li> As required or permitted by law: Sometimes the law requires Vanadium to disclose personal
                    information. For example, information may be disclosed to a court in response to a subpoena, or to a
                    Government agency such as the Australian Taxation Office on receipt of a direction issued under
                    taxation laws. </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h2> Access to and currency of personal information Vanadium holds </h2>
                <p class="pb-5"> Vanadium takes reasonable steps to ensure that all personal information we collect or use
                  is accurate, complete and up-to-date. You can assist us by advising promptly if your details change.
                  Please be aware that Vanadium will need to verify your identity before your personal details can be
                  changed. </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h2> Security of your personal information </h2>
                <p>
                  Vanadium takes reasonable steps such as implementation of procedures and installation of equipment to
                  ensure that the personal information we collect is stored in a secure environment; and accessed only by
                  authorised personnel for permitted purposes.<br /><br />
                  Use of the internet is inherently risky, but Vanadium uses measures to help ensure that the personal
                  information of clients and users of our website is not subject to unauthorised access, modification or
                  disclosure, or misuse, interference or loss.. However, if you access another website through a link from
                  the Vanadium website, the privacy policy of the owner of the other website will apply. Vanadium does not
                  accept responsibility for the compliance of linked websites in the handling of your personal
                  information.<br /><br />
                  When the personal information Vanadium has collected is no longer needed for the purpose for which it
                  was collected or no longer required under law, Vanadium will take reasonable steps to destroy or
                  deidentify it.<br /><br />
